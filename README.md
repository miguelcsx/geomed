# GeoMed: Geometry Made Interactive

GeoMed is a web-based visualization tool built with React and d3.js, offering users a dynamic platform to explore, visualize, and experiment with various Euclidean geometry concepts. Whether you're a student, teacher, or geometry enthusiast, GeoMed provides an interactive space for learning and visually representing geoemtry principles.


## Planned Features

- **Geometry Visualization**: Display and visualize constructions, theorems, and definitions in Euclidean geometry.
- **Interactive Graphical Representation**: Create, edit, and manipulate geometric elements in real-time.
- **Measurement Tools**: Calculate angles, distances, and areas to gain insights into geometric properties.
- **Geometry Transformations**: Apply translations, rotations, and reflections to geometric objects.
- **Angle Bisectors and Perpendicular Bisectors**: Construct angle bisectors and perpendicular bisectors for angles or line segments.
- **Triangle Properties**: Explore triangle congruence and similarity, visualizing their properties.
- **Interactive Proofs**: Construct and demonstrate geometric proofs with step-by-step guidance.
- **Customization**: Personalize the appearance of geometric elements with various colors and styles.
- **Export and Save**: Save your visualizations, export images, and easily share your constructions with others.
